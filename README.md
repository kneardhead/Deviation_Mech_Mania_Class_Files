# Deviation Scientific Society MechMania Files
This repo holds all the documents (I guess so) that I edited for taking three Mechanics Tutorials in Deviation Scientific Society (club) before the Regional Physics Olympiad.

I have worked mainly in LaTeX and used beamer for the presentation jobs (writing without a graphics tab in computer with mouse really suck, so I better write them before). 

**Warning**: You will probably fall in trouble trying to compile these depending your skills. I recommend you to read the \usepackage{ bla bla } carefully and try to work that out first. It compiles perfectly in my system. I recommend you to compile it using this way in your command prompt/terminal. 
```
xelatex day1.tex
```
If find this more stable and it works out most of the time.
