# Deviation Scientific Society MechMania Files
This repo holds all the documents (I guess so) that I edited for taking three Mechanics Tutorials in Deviation Scientific Society (club) before the Regional Physics Olympiad.

I have worked mainly in LaTeX and used beamer for the presentation jobs (writing without a graphics tab in computer with mouse really suck, so I better write them before). Zathura with nord pywal theme was used, so those who did the class might find the colorscheme unknown :3 

**Warning**: You will probably fall in trouble trying to compile these depending your skills. I recommend you to read the \usepackage{ bla bla } carefully and try to work that out first. It compiles perfectly in my system. I recommend you to compile it using this way in your command prompt/terminal. 
```
xelatex day1.tex
```
If find this more stable and it works out most of the time. 

I really did not care about the uniform order or keeping my files arranged while working, I'd just vim into the required files, 
```
day1.tex  day2.tex  day3.tex
```
And do the required writing. So this github repo is quite messy. 

##Day 1: Using Force as Vectors 
Talks about solving problems using Force as vectors, nothing great, just using sin and cos to balance forces and find equations to solve variables. 

##Day 2: Using Conservation Laws
Momentum and Energy, importantly includes Jaan Kalda Mechanics Method 6, which talks about Generalized Coordinates (motivates Analytical Mechanics) and some low depth analysis that will help out solving some good problems.

##Day 3: Extra
I discussed things I thought would be more necessary and solved some more problems so that the pupil could relate with the last 2 days. 

The biggest takeaway from the interaction was discussions of good problems solvings, law of physics, and at day 3, you guessed, Linux. xD
