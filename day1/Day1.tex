Hence, \[ r \sin \alpha =  r \cos ( 90^{\circ} - \alpha) \] \[ r \cos\alpha =
r \sin (90^{\circ} - \alpha)  \]   So, we now know that, \begin{align*}
\sin(90^{\circ} - \alpha ) = \cos \alpha \\ \cos(90^{\circ} - \alpha) =

    {Warm Up: Cosine Law --- For Vector}
    {
   We will use vectors very often in physics, so it is better we try it out before starting.
    At first, vectors can be added in this way, \\
    Vectors can be added, like, 
    \[ \vec a + \vec b \]
Which looks like one vector is put infront of another. }{

    {Vector Triangle for Cosine Law}
    {If there is a side $a$ and $b$, then assuming the third side is $c$, the Law of cosine is to find the length of $c$ using the lengths of $a$ and $b$, and the angle $a$ and $b$ makes. \\
    The easiest solution can be found using $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ vector methods. We know angle $\theta$ between $a$ and $b$ }{
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \centering
        \draw[-stealth, red](0,0) -- (3,2) node[above]{$ \vec a$}; 
        \draw[-stealth, red](0,0) -- (1, 3) node[above]{$\vec b $};
        \draw[-stealth, green](3,2) -- (1,3) node[midway,above]{$\vec c= \vec a + \vec b$};
\end{tikzpicture}}
\section{Frame Break}



    Now let us have a triangle with side $\vec a$ and $\vec b$, then the third side is obviously $\vec b - \vec a$. This is same as we saw in last frame. Now, let the third side be $\vec c = \vec b - \vec a$, then can we find a scalar solution for the length of vector $\vec c$?\\
    \begin{align*}
        \vec c &= \vec b - \vec a \\     
        \left(  \vec c \right) ^2 &=  \left( \vec b - \vec a \right) ^2 \\  
        \vec c \cdot \vec c &= \vec a \cdot \vec a -
        2 \vec a \cdot \vec b +
        \vec b \cdot \vec b 
    \end{align*}
    Now, $\vec a \cdot \vec b$, is the dot product. And for a dot product, 
    \[ \vec a \cdot \vec b = |a| \ |b| \ \cos \theta  \]  
    And if, 
    \[ \vec a \cdot \vec a = |a| |a | \cos \left( 0 \right)  \]  
    Because $\vec a$ makes $0 ^{\circ}$ with itself. Hence, we have, 
    \[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos\theta \]
    So, we have found length of third side,  \[ c=
    \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos \theta}  \]

\[ \frac{a}{\sin A} \,=\, \frac{c}{\sin C} \,=\, \frac{d}{\sin D} \, = \, 2r\]
\textbf{\textsf{Proof:}} Let $\triangle ACD$ be the required triangle, we want to build a relation between the length of the sides and the opposite angles to them motivated from the fact that the opposite angle being large making the side project a larger length.

\section{Frame Break}




 Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle ACD$ and we draw a diameter $DE$ that passes through the center of $\Gamma$ which is point $O$. \\
 $\triangle ECD$ is a Right Angled Triangle because it meets the \emph{Semi-circle} and thus,
 \[ \sin \angle CED = \frac{\Bar{CD}}{\Bar{ED}}\]
 Using the \emph{Arc and Angle Theorem} we can see that  
 \[ \angle CED = \angle CAD = \angle A \]
 As we know that $DE = 2r$ we are left to show that,
 \begin{align}
 \sin \angle CED &=  \frac{\Bar{CD}}{\Bar{ED}} \notag \\
 \sin \angle A & = \frac{a}{2r} \\
 \frac{a}{\sin A} & = 2r
 \end{align}
 And this can be again and again be proved for all the three remaining sides,
 \begin{equation}
 \frac{a}{\sin A} \,=\, \frac{c}{\sin C} \,=\, \frac{d}{\sin D} \, = \, 2r
 \end{equation}
 And we are done with the proof.

{ Answer final} 
    Now using the fact $a_1 = a_2 = a$, 
        \begin{align*} m_1 a &=
        m_1 g - T \\ m_2 a &=  T - m_2 g \sin\alpha    
    \end{align*}
    To solve this equations, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $T = m_2 a + m_2 g \sin\alpha $  
        \item Put this in second equation, $  m_1 a = m_1g - \left( m_2 a + m_2 g \sin\alpha  \right)      $.  
        \item Solve this for, $a$, you will have, $m_1 g - m_2 g \sin \alpha = (m_1 + m_2) a$
        \item We have, $a = \frac{g (m_1 - m_2 \sin\alpha )}{m_1 + m_2}$
    \end{itemize}
    Note that, if $m_1 > m_2 \sin\alpha $, then $a >0$, which means $a$ is positive and the acceleration is positive, which follows the convention $m_1$ falling down is positive.
    Hence, \[ \boxed{  a = \frac{g \left( m_1 - m_2 \sin \alpha  \right) }{m_1 + m_2}}  \]

The equations that we had, 
\begin{itemize} 
    \item $m_2 a = T - m_2 g \sin\alpha - F_f= T - m_2 g \sin \alpha - \left( m_2 g\mu \cos \alpha \right)   $.

            \item Please note that this equation only hold if there is motion where $m_2 $ lifts up. Otherwise the sign of friction will change. 
\end{itemize}
Similarly solving we get, only for positive motion case, 
\[ \boxed{ a = \frac{g \left( m_1 - m_2 \sin\alpha - m_2 \mu \cos \alpha  \right) }{m_1 + m_2}}  \]

We need to write the equation again. Because the direction of friction will change for different motion, where $m_2$ falls down along the rame. We have to write, 
\begin{myitemize} 
        \item $m_2 a = -T + m_2 g \sin\alpha - F_f$.  
            \item $m_1 a =  T- m_1 g$.  
                \end{myitemize}
                This is solved to get, \[ \boxed{  a = \frac{g (m_2 \sin \alpha - m_2 \mu \cos \alpha - m_1) }{m_1 + m_2}} \]

\[ \boxed{ a = \frac{g \left( m_1 - m_2 \sin\alpha - m_2 \mu \cos \alpha  \right) }{m_1 + m_2}}  \]}
These are two cases, first for $m_2$ getting down, second for $m_2$ getting up. \\
We can define the condition of getting up, down, or resting in position because of friction.\\
To $m_2$ get down, we need, 
\[ m_2 \sin \alpha - m_2 \mu \cos \alpha - m_1 > 0 \quad \to \quad m_1 -m_2 \sin \alpha + m_2 \mu \cos \alpha < 0\]

    { We need the Radius of Rotation, which is found in the figures, we calculate it, 
    \[ r=R \sin \theta \]

    \[ F_c = m\omega^2 r = m \omega^2 R \sin \theta  \]

    { Problem 2: Balance force for Stationary condition}
    We need total force $0$, \[ mg \sin \theta - \left( m \omega^2 R \sin \theta \right) \cos \theta =0 \]
    \[ g \sin \theta = \omega^2 R \cos \theta \sin\theta \]
    And we have, \[ \cos \theta = \frac{g}{\omega^2 R}  \]
    The angle $\theta$ is, \[ \boxed{  \theta = \cos^{-1} \left(  \frac{g}{\omega^2 R} \right) } \]

    { Rotational Mechanics (Quick)}
    {\textbf{ Torque}\\
    Torque is rotational force. 

    Like force, Torque causes acceleration of rotation, \[ \tau = I \alpha \]
    Where, $I$ is Moment of Inertia, which is like Mass for rotating bodies. \\
$I$ depends on the Geometry and Mass of the system. 
\[ \tau = r \times F \]

    { Extending Torque Idea}
    {In case the $F$ makes an angle with the radius vector $r$, we have to add a $\sin \theta$ factor for the perpendicular projection,\[ \tau = r \times F \sin \theta \]
    }{   
\draw{ 0.9}{ torque_sin}{ }  }
\id{ Most of the rules of Force can be used for Torque too, for example, torque is balanced too.}

    { Angular Momentum}
    Like the momentum we learned few minutes ago, angular momentum is also like that, 
\[ p = mv \]
And similarly
    \[ L = I \omega \]
    Where $I$ is  known, and $\omega$ is Angular Speed. \\
    Please note that these are vector, but we don't need the vector law for Angular Dynamcics right now.

    { Problem 3: Some Idea on Torque using last Idea}

{ \prob{  Three rods are connected by hinges to each other, the outermost ones are hinged to a ceiling at point $A$, and $B$, the distance between these are equal of a rod. A weight is hanged at $C$, find the minimum force applied at $D$ to keep the system in Balance.}}{

{ \draw{ 0.9}{ prob3_1}{ }  }{ \draw{ 0.9}{ prob3_2}{ }   } 
Please note, for the pivot $B$, if we can stop rotation by axis of $B$, then the system can be balanced.

    { Finding angles for Problem 3}
    { This is sure that, 
    \[ L \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} L \]
    Thus, 
\[ \theta = 30^{\circ} \]
    From here, \[ \alpha = 90^{\circ} - \theta = 60^{\circ} \]
    Now, the angle that the $mg$ vector makes with the left side of the rod is, 
    \[ 90^{\circ} + \alpha = 90^{\circ} + 60 ^{\circ} = 150^{\circ} \]
    So, angle $m \vec g$ makes with the left rod is $150 ^{\circ}$.

    {Torque balance rules for Problem 3. }

    Like force balance, we have to invoke Torque balance, because, 
    \begin{myitemize}
    \item Force balance is similar to Torque Balance  
    \item In this problem, we need to apply force at $D$, and if you notice, the motion of $D$ is like the rotation of right rod pivoting $B$.  
    \item To balance the system, we need to balance the \emph{Rotation}. 
    \end{myitemize}
    
\section{Frame Break}

    So, the torque on the left side of the rod, 
    \[ \tau = mg L \sin \left( 150 ^{\circ} \right)  \]
        And $\sin 150^{\circ} = \frac{1}{2}$, hence, 
        \[ \tau = \frac{mg}{2}L \]
        I have something to add here too, 
        \begin{myitemize}
        \item In the $mg$ force vector, some force is $\perp$ perpendicular to the rod (prjection)
        \item Some force is along the rod. 
        \end{myitemize}
        The force components that are along the rod are uimportant, because they pull the left rod and do nothing. 
\section{Frame Break}
 {Final thoughts on Problem 3}
    Now we add some logic.   \\
    If left side has torque $\tau$ where $\tau = \frac{mg}{2} L$, then if we apply the same torque on the right side, then we have a torque balance, which will also balance the system, hence, on the right side, we also apply a torque $\tau '$ which is,    
    \[ \tau ' = \frac{mg}{2} L \]
    And $\tau = F L$, thus, 
    \[ F = \frac{mg}{2} \]  
    This force is perpendicular to the rod, and solely works to balance the system, without any component along the rod, hence, no force is wasted and $F = \frac{mg}{2}$ is the minimum force possible.  
    \[ \boxed{F = \frac{mg}{2} }  \]
